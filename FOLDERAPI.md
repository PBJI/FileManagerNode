### 1. `createFolderStructure(basePath, folderArray)`

This method creates a folder structure based on a nested array representation. The following examples demonstrate its usage, including edge cases:

#### Basic Structure Creation

```javascript
const fileManager = new FileManager();

// Creating a basic folder structure
fileManager.createFolderStructure('/base/path', ['folder1', 'folder2']);

// Expected: /base/path/folder1 and /base/path/folder2 created
```

#### Nested Structure Creation

```javascript
// Creating a nested folder structure
fileManager.createFolderStructure('/base/path', ['folder1', ['subfolder1', 'subfolder2'], 'folder2']);

// Expected: /base/path/folder1, /base/path/subfolder1, /base/path/subfolder2, /base/path/folder2 created
```

#### Repeated Calls

```javascript
// Creating the same structure again
fileManager.createFolderStructure('/base/path', ['folder1', ['subfolder1', 'subfolder2'], 'folder2']);

// Expected: No errors, folders should not be recreated since they already exist
```

#### Non-Existent Base Path

```javascript
// Attempting to create a folder structure in a non-existent base path
try {
    fileManager.createFolderStructure('/nonexistent/base/path', ['folderA']);
} catch (error) {
    console.error(error.message); // Expected: An error indicating that the base path does not exist
}

// Expected: No folders created
```

#### Deeply Nested Structure

```javascript
// Creating a deeply nested folder structure
fileManager.createFolderStructure('/base/path', ['folder1', ['subfolder1', ['subsubfolder1', 'subsubfolder2']]]);

// Expected: /base/path/folder1, /base/path/subfolder1, /base/path/subfolder1/subsubfolder1, /base/path/subfolder1/subsubfolder2 created
```

#### Special Characters in Folder Names

```javascript
// Creating folders with special characters
fileManager.createFolderStructure('/base/path', ['folder_@#$', ['subfolder%&*', 'another_folder']]);

// Expected: /base/path/folder_@#$, /base/path/subfolder%&*, /base/path/another_folder created
```

### 2. `deleteFolderStructure(basePath, folderArray)`

This method deletes specific folders based on a structure defined in an array. The following examples include various edge cases:

#### Basic Structure Deletion

```javascript
// Deleting a basic folder structure
fileManager.deleteFolderStructure('/base/path', ['folder1', 'folder2']);

// Expected: /base/path/folder1 and /base/path/folder2 deleted
```

#### Deleting Nested Structures

```javascript
// Deleting a nested folder structure
fileManager.deleteFolderStructure('/base/path', ['folder1', ['subfolder1', 'subfolder2']]);

// Expected: /base/path/folder1, /base/path/subfolder1, and /base/path/subfolder2 deleted
```

#### Using Wildcards for Deletion

```javascript
// Deleting folders using wildcard
fileManager.deleteFolderStructure('/base/path', ['folder1', '*', ['subfolder1']]);

// Expected: All folders in /base/path deleted, and /base/path/subfolder1 deleted
```

#### Non-Existent Folders

```javascript
// Attempting to delete a folder that does not exist
fileManager.deleteFolderStructure('/base/path', ['nonexistent_folder']);

// Expected: Log output indicating that the folder does not exist; no errors thrown
```

#### Edge Case: Delete Parent Folder (Up a Directory)

```javascript
// Attempting to delete using '..' to go up a directory
fileManager.deleteFolderStructure('/base/path', ['..']);

// Expected: No action taken; should ideally not allow deletion of base path
```

#### Deeply Nested Deletion

```javascript
// Deleting a deeply nested folder structure
fileManager.deleteFolderStructure('/base/path', ['folder1', ['subfolder1', ['subsubfolder1']]]);

// Expected: /base/path/folder1, /base/path/subfolder1, and /base/path/subfolder1/subsubfolder1 deleted
```

#### Invalid Folder Structure

```javascript
// Attempting to delete an invalid structure (empty array)
fileManager.deleteFolderStructure('/base/path', []);

// Expected: No action taken; should not throw an error
```

#### Handle Mixed Structures

```javascript
// Deleting a mixed folder structure with valid and invalid paths
fileManager.deleteFolderStructure('/base/path', ['folder1', 'invalid_folder', '*', ['subfolder1']]);

// Expected: folder1 and subfolder1 deleted, log indicating invalid_folder was not found
```

### Summary of Edge Cases
- Creating folders in a non-existent base path.
- Handling special characters in folder names.
- Deleting folders that do not exist without throwing errors.
- Using wildcards to delete multiple folders.
- Safeguarding against deleting the base path inadvertently.
- Deleting a mixed structure of valid and invalid paths.

By implementing these tests and examples, you can ensure that your folder creation and deletion functionalities are robust, handle various scenarios gracefully, and provide clear feedback to the user.
